* **Logical: Relational diagram that details the tables, attributes, primary and foreign keys, normalized to ensure data integrity.
* **Physical: SQL scripts for creating tables, indexes and constraints in the chosen database (specify the DBMS used, for example, PostgreSQL, MySQL).

## Repository Structure

* **scripts: Contains the SQL scripts for creating the database.
* **documentation: Additional documentation, such as a report explaining the modeling decisions.

## Technologies Used
